## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains: 

1. run_analysis.R - R scripts that read, modify, and manipulate the original training and test data sets to get a tidy data set, called "tidydata.txt". Note that all data files should be placed in the working directory for this R code to run successfully. 

2. CodeBook.md - the code book that describes the data, the variables, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the original data sets to get a tidy data set.   

3. tidydata.txt - the tidy data set that has been generated by running the R scripts, run_analysis.R: The tidy dataset includes the average of each feature for each activity and each subject.

[The data used for this project are "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
